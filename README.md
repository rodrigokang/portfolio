## Projects

### [Asset Allocation](./asset_allocation)
An in-depth analysis and model development for optimal asset allocation using modern portfolio theory and machine learning techniques.

### [Financial Derivatives](./financial_derivatives)
Modeling and analysis of financial derivatives, exploring pricing, risk management, and trading strategies using quantitative methods.

### [Handwritten Digit Recognition](./handwritten_digit_recognition)
A machine learning project focusing on the recognition of handwritten digits using various classification algorithms and neural networks.

### [Housing Price](./housing_price)
A project to predict housing prices based on various features using linear regression and other predictive modeling techniques.

### [Retail Customer Segmentation](./retail_dashboard)
A comprehensive project focused on customer segmentation for a retail dataset using the Northwind database. By leveraging RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) variables and scores, this project implements K-Means clustering to segment customers into different clusters. The segmented data is used to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. SQL queries are used to extract and preprocess the data from the database.

### [Blockchain](./blockchain)
Investigating blockchain technology and its applications, including smart contracts, cryptographic security, and decentralized applications.

### [Fraud Detection](./fraud_detection)
Developing machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, enhancing security and reducing financial losses.

### [Quantum Control Theory](./quantum_control_theory)
Projects on the control of quantum systems, focusing on the application of control theory to quantum computing and quantum information processing.
