    "In this project, I aim to predict customer churn for the well-known Northwind database by leveraging Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) variables along with the RFM score that I previously developed using K-Means clustering. Churn is defined as customers who belong to the 'low activity customers' category in the 'category' field, making the target variable a binary outcome. The goal is to develop and compare the performance of various Machine Learning algorithms in predicting churn, using the variables 'R', 'F', 'M', and 'score' as predictors.\n",
