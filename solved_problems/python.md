# `Python` Programming Problems

## Variables

1. Summarize the principles outlined in the Zen of Python.
2. List all the keywords in Python.
3. Retrieve a list of magic commands in Python.
4. Use the `dir()` function to list all the functions and constants available in the `math` and `cmath` libraries.
5. Select the function `sqrt` from both libraries (`math.sqrt` and `cmath.sqrt`) and use the `help()` function to display the documentation for each. Compare how the `sqrt` function differs between the two libraries.
6. Assign the values `7` and `3` to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. Perform the following operations on `x` and `y`: 
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Integer division (`//`)
  - Modulus (remainder of the division)
  - Exponentiation (`x ** y`)

    For each operation, print the result and specify the data type of the output.

7. **Part (a):**
   - Given the complex number $z = 4 + 3j$, assign it to the variable `z`.
   - Verify that `z` is a complex number.
   - Obtain and print the real and imaginary parts of `z`.

   **Part (b):**
   - Evaluate the sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division of the complex numbers $z_1 = -1 - 1j$ and $z_2 = 1 - 1j$.

   **Part (c):**
   - For the complex number $z_3 = -2 + 1j$, calculate and print its:
     - Conjugate
     - Modulus (magnitude)
     - Phase (angle in radians)

   **Part (d):**
   - Given the complex number $z_4 = 1 + 1j$, convert it to polar form.
   - Then, convert it back to its binomial form from the polar form.
