# Retail Customer Segmentation Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive solution for customer segmentation in a retail environment. The dashboard integrates K-Means clustering to segment customers into different clusters based on their Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) scores. This targeted approach helps in understanding and analyzing customer behavior effectively.

The project leverages the **Northwind** database as the data source, with **Flask** serving as the backend for API creation and **Streamlit** for the frontend. HTML and CSS are used in combination to enhance the user interface, offering a sleek and intuitive experience.
