# Retail Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn in a retail environment. The dashboard integrates various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and KNN, all of which are based on a Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model. The customer base is segmented into different clusters using K-Means, providing a targeted approach to churn prediction.

The project leverages the **Northwind** database as the data source, with **Flask** serving as the backend for API creation and **Streamlit** for the frontend. HTML and CSS are used in combination to enhance the user interface, offering a sleek and intuitive experience.

## Features
